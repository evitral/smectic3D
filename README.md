# smectic3D
FFT Phase Field Model for a 3D Smectic

1. pf3d.cpp : basic FFTW for the 3d smectic

2. pf3dST : Same as (1), but used before surfTrack (no real difference)

3. pf3dMorph : Same as (1), with hyperboloid like IC

4. surfTrack : Tracks surface velocity

5. cosNoAdvMorph : DCT for (3) IC, without adevction
